# Introduction
SaltyGME is a chiptune player for Google Chrome's Native Client (NaCl).

SaltyGME started as a Native Client frontend for the
[Game Music Emu library](http://www.slack.net/~ant/libs/audio.html). The 
player was then expanded to include multiple multiple chiptune
player backends.

The NaCl player is [available as a Chrome browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leooadmebmmjogbfhdcbfldndllfkhpg) in the Chrome Web Store.
It works under Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. [Visit the Game Music Appreciation](http://gamemusic.multimedia.cx/)
